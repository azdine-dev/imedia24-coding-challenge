## Getting Started

This section provides instructions on how to get the application up and running using Docker.

### Prerequisites

- Docker: [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

### Build and Run the Docker Image

To build the Docker image and run the application as a container:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <project-directory>
   
2. Build the docker image
   docker build -t <image-name> .

3. Run the container:
   docker run -p <host-port>:<container-port> <image-name>
   
   Replace <host-port> with the port you want to use on the host machine (e.g., 8080) 
   and <container-port> with the port your Spring Boot application
   listens on inside the container (e.g., 8080).

4. Access the application:
   Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:<host-port>
   to access the running application.
